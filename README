A simple webcam script.

Press the space bar and it'll count down from three.  At zero it will save the
current image to the images/ folder.  Esc to close.  Works on Linux, probably
doesn't work on Windows.

This was a short little project that I wrote on a whim.  There is lots of room
for improvement, but I doubt I'll ever get much further than what I have here.
